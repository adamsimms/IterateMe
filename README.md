# ðŸ‘‹ Greeting Fellow Geeks ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this 1337 place where I grow my knowledge and feed my curiosity about software and engineering! 

<br />

## ðŸ‘¾ WHOAMI ðŸ‘¾
I'm currently a computer engineering student. For the past 3 years, I've been on an adventure to explore various technologies to discover where I would like to focus my career. During this time I had had lot of fun playing with microcontrollers like the Rasperry Pi, Arduino and the Espressif family.  

More recently, I dedicated my time to Hack The Box, which helped me gain fundamental cybersecurity knowledge. My focus has been primarily AppSec, since this is the career direction that excites me the most.

More recently, I dedicated a significant amount of time on Hack The Box, which enabled me to learn the fundamentals of cybersecurity with a focus on AppSec. This experience with cybersecurity has pointed me in the direction that I'm most excited by for my career.

I am progressively looking to contribute to or build projects in the cybersecurity domain. To be continued...<br/>

<br />

### - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
[My current project is a Puzzle Box](https://github.com/IterateMe/puzzle_box) based on an ESP8266. I am doing this project because it is an exciting engineering challenge with design choices, requires me to perform interesting tests along the journey, and helps me understand the Espressif platform deeply.

<br />

### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- Application penetration testing (XSS, SQLi, XXE, CSRF, ... and linux privilege escalation.)
- Securing Web Apps with tools, architecture, and good design patterns.<br />

<br />

### - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...  
Cybersec toolsâ€“mainly a Linux CLI tool for application penetration testing or an MCU-based tool for RF-based penetration testing (WiFi, Bluetooth, or other IoT-related tools.)

## ðŸ’¾ PROJECTS ðŸ’¾

### - ðŸŽ“ Engineering student projects ...

- [This project based on the SunFOunder PiCar](https://github.com/IterateMe/SunFounder_PiCar) was an exciting challenge because we had to use relatively unreliable sensors to make the PiCar follow a trajectory with obstacles. We used statistics to simulate the sensor's behaviours and state machine principles to react to various perceived environmental constraints.
- [This project was the REACT user interface for a web server running on an FPGA](https://github.com/IterateMe/alco2bin).  It was an interesting first start with REACT and javascript! My team tried a new workflow where we designed the app in Figma and then implemented it in react... unfortunately, the outcome didn't go as we had hoped, but it was a great learning experience!

<br />

### - ðŸŒŸ Personnal projects ...
- The Funky_PAD has been a project I spent a lot of time on and tested with actual users. The problem I tried to address is that despite all the available tools on the market, static posture significantly impairs focus while using standing desks. I built the [first version of a prototype](https://github.com/IterateMe/funky_PAD) with an antifatigue mat and simple coin-shaped actuators that would vibrate at a steady "beat" to mimic walking patterns. [The second version](https://github.com/IterateMe/FUNKY_PAD_V2), based on user feedback, introduced biofeedback with the help of piezoelectrics. The challenging part of the project was enabling the piezoelectrics to produce an analog signal while pressing and releasing the foot on the mat. 
- The implementation of a [jukebox inside a modified toy robot](https://github.com/IterateMe/JukeBot). I built this simple proof of concept to challenge myself to see how fast I could develop a working project.

<br />

### - ðŸŽ‡ My contributions ...
- For an amateur Rocketery university student project (Projet CASUS), I contributed to:
  - The design and implementation of a [signal processing software](https://github.com/Projet-CASUS/Vibes) that manipulates accelerometer data to create a .wav file that is played by haptic actuators.
  - The implementation of the [data acquisition payload](https://github.com/Projet-CASUS/MKRZ_MPU6050).
- Another project I wanted to contribute to because I used their platform quite a lot was the [IoT for Beginners course from the Microsoft team](https://github.com/IterateMe/IoT-For-Beginners). I simply started the French translation by translating a few chapters! 

<br />

### - ðŸ’¥ First blood ...  
### V1  
[The project that got me started in computer engineering](https://github.com/IterateMe/Garden_AuTomate_RPi) was a simple garden watering scheduler that I actually still use to this day! The first version was a local web app running on Python with Flask on a Raspberry Pi, a single 24V electric valve, a board with LEDs and buttons, and a RC filter.

### V2  
This version was an excellent opportunity to play around with Azure IoT Hub and understand how to use cheap devices like the ESP8266 with this powerful platform. I upgraded the [device](https://github.com/IterateMe/Garden_AuTomate_ESP8266/) part of the provice over the years on a $3,50 ESP8266 to work securely through Azure IoT Hub and added two more valves.  

The [project](https://github.com/IterateMe/Garden_Automate_dotnet_react) is still in progress as it is a great playground for me to learn C# and the .NET framework, along with Azure App Services and Azure DevOps for CI/CD.
